    "## Summary\n",
    "Google's NLP API is easy to implement, robust, and reliable. There are three main functions that would apply to our app. In summary, Sentiment Analysis is pretty good and straightforward, Entity Analysis has a lot of potential for advanced analytics, and Topics Analysis is really really useful for identifying clusters. Overall, I think this option is viable and promising. "

    "## Summary\n",
    "Google's NLP API is easy to implement, robust, and reliable. There are three main functions that would apply to our app. In summary, Sentiment Analysis is pretty good and straightforward, Entity Analysis has a lot of potential for advanced analytics, and Topics Analysis is really really useful for identifying clusters. Overall, I think this option is viable and promising. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "- 3 applicable functions (sentiment, entity, and topic analyses) + 1 potentially-useful function (syntax/speech analysis) \n",
    "- Sentiment score seems pretty accurate and magnitude can be used to evaluate how strong/extreme a user's feelings are\n",
    "- Entity analysis is quite robust and can provide a lot of data for heavy data science and analytics in syntax\n",
    "- Topic analysis is super useful in terms of clustering and suggesting interest (HUGE)\n",
    "- Reliable, cheap, and really easy to implement\n",
    "- If we end up using Google Cloud for backend, implementation should be much simpler. Google also has many other services that are compatible with the resources we have (API keys, accounts, databases, etc.)\n",
    "- Good documentation and sample projects available online\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- Slow? Not really sure how fast it should be. My code can probably be optimized further\n",
    "- Doesn't analyze short text well\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis is 1 dimensional (one value from -1 to 1)\n",
    "- Some functions might have been deprecated\n",
    "- Not free?"
